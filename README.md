This game was created as part of the Global Games Jam 2025 at the University of Southampton: https://globalgamejam.org/

I have included the Unity code and assets in this repo and the game is playable on [itch](https://harveymannering.itch.io/bubble-squared).

Ready, aim, pop! Take on the challenge of bursting as many bubbles as you can in 60 seconds.

Aim by clicking and dragging across the screen, then release to shoot arrows.

Chain your shots to pop multiple bubbles at once and rack up combos for a high score!
